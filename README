WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

Here are the files required to set-up a Web site which allows
full-text search of the Cablegate's cables released by Wikileaks.

These files have been used by http://www.cablegatesearch.net/
since Dec. 9th as a free service to allow people to easily browse
the *released* cables.

I consider the code here to be raw and still quite under development,
and rather untidy and often messy, however, there has been interest
to maybe reuse the code here in order to create an offline, portable
full-text search of the cables, hence this early release.

Obviously I will keep working on this code, to make it more tidy,
better documented, and to introduce optimizations as the number of
released cables goes up, and performance issues are identified. Etc.

This website's code has been running on:
- Apache/2.0.52 (CentOS)
- PHP 5.1.6
- MySQL 4.1.20

This website's code has been developed on:
- Apache/2.2.16 (Ubuntu)
- PHP 5.3.3-1ubuntu9.3
- MySQL 5.1.49


FILES
-----

- dbconnect.php:
	To connect to the MySQL server, this is where
	you fill in your database name, user id, password.

- cacher.php:
	Cache management, to save CPU cycles. Can be turned off. There
	need to be a directory named "cache" with read/write permission
	for all for the cacher to work properly. This was ported from
	a previous project, naming is inconsistent, and there are issues
	to resolve in the current project, particularly, when the database
	is updated, the cache needs to be flushed manually currently.

- browse.php:
	Experimental, not completed, to browse the tags used
	in the cables

- cable.php:
	Web page to display the content of a single cable

- cablegate-do.php:
	XMLHttpRequests' entry point

- cablegate-functions.php:
	contains functions reused across multiple PHP files. It needs
	cleanup.

- cablegate-create.sql:
	MySQL statements to create the structure of the
	tables required to run the site

- cablegate-create-and-populate.sql.7z:
	MySQL statements to create the structures of the
	tables required to run this site, and to fill them with the data
	of the latest snapshot of released cables. Since this file is
	way too large to host here (currently ~20MB), download it from:
	http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cablegate-create-and-populate.sql.7z

- cables.7z:
	Contains all the unique versions of all the cables published by
	Wikileaks so far. Because of its size (currently 40-50MB), this
	7-Zip file is only available on the server, rather than being committed
	here: http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cables.7z
	The filename of each cable is composed as follow:
	{release date as YYYMMDDHHmm}_{A 6-digit release id in DB}_{A 6-digit cable id in DB}_{canonical id}.html
	If the database needs to be rebuilt from scratch, it will be
	possible to keep the same id as before, which is especially important
	for the cart.php feature.
	Keep in mind a same cable could have been published more than
	once. A cable file of size 0 means the cable had been removed from
	the release.

- cart.php:
	A tool to collate and persist a specific set of cables

- extras.php:
	Unsorted features are put in there

- finediff.php:
	FineDiff class, used to by cable.php to render cable content

- footer.php:
	Contact, credits, etc. This file is included as footer
	in the main PHP files.

- header.php:
	The HTML code shared by all web pages, which appears just below
	the title bar

- globals.php:
	This file is included by a few PHP files. It's likely going to be replaced
	soon by a serialized PHP variable useful across many pages on the site.

- history.php:
	Documents the addition, modification, deletion of
	cables by Wikileaks

- index.php:
	Redirect to search.php

- release-notes.php:
	Release notes, I'm not very good at keeping this up to
	date.

- search.php:
	The main web page to launch a full-text search

- uorigin.php:
	Unclassified cables by origin


- mootools-core-1.3-loader.inc:
	HTML snippet to load Mootools Core 1.3. I use a proxy loader which requires
	a key, which is generated according to the domain name cablegatesearch.net.
	You will have to change this to your own key, or simply load directly
	mootool-core.js (see http://mootools.net)

- CSS files:
	cablegate.css
	cablegate-list.css = to be used for list of cables
	cablegate-cart.css = to be used for cart operations

- Javascript files:
	cablegate.js: more stuff (need to restructure these files)
	cablegate-cart.js: cart management
	cablegate-search.js: list of suggestions for search keyword
	mootools-more.js: Mootools More, for visual effects, date handling, etc.
