WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

Here are the files required to set-up a Web site which allows
full-text search of the Cablegate's cables released by Wikileaks.

These files have been used by http://www.cablegatesearch.net/
since Dec. 9th as a free service to allow people to easily browse
the *released* cables.

I consider the code here to be raw and still quite under development,
and rather untidy and often messy, however, there has been interest
to maybe reuse the code here in order to create an offline, portable
full-text search of the cables, hence this early release.

Obviously I will keep working on this code, to make it more tidy,
better documented, and to introduce optimizations as the number of
released cables goes up, and performance issues are identified. Etc.

This website's code has been running on:
- Apache/2.0.52 (CentOS)
- PHP 5.1.6
- MySQL 4.1.20

This website's code has been developed on:
- Apache/2.2.16 (Ubuntu)
- PHP 5.3.3-1ubuntu9.3
- MySQL 5.1.49
